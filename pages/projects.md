  I build tools to solve my own problems. Usually, that involves automation, data organization, or simple quality-of-life improvements.

## Active Development

### Anki Automation Tool
**Automated Flashcard Generation CLI**

A command-line tool that converts markdown notes into Anki flashcards using LLMs. It solves the friction of manually creating cards, allowing me to focus on learning rather than data entry.

*   **Stack**: Python, OpenAI API, AnkiConnect
*   **Status**: <span style={{color: "var(--primary)"}}>v1.0 Released</span>

```bash
# Example usage
anki-tool generate --input notes.md --deck "Advanced Systems"
```

## TODO - Add other projects

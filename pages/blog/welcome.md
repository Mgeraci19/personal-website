# Welcome

This is a blog post written in **MDX**. That means I can write Markdown as usual, but I can also import and use React components if I want to!

## Why I built this

I wanted a place to share my thoughts that I fully own. By using Next.js and GitHub Pages, I have complete control over the design and content.

### What's next?
- Adding more project writeups
- Customizing the design
- Sharing interesting links

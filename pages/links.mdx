## Blogs
* [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy/.com/) - Good blog with fun illustrations
* [Mr Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) - An interesting take on personal finance written by a curmudgeon who I *mostly* agree with.


## Videos

* John Stewart on Crossfire [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE&list=LL&index=89) - Imagine having a rant so good they literally cancel the whole show


## Newsletters
I try to avoid subscribing to too many newsletters but these are a few exceptions.
*   [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com/) - A great newsletter for tech and startup news.
*   [YLE Your local epidemiologist](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/) - Trying to read up on Public Health, this has been a good resource

## High-level
I want to have a minimalist personal website that links to my github, linkedin, and has a basic blog structure on it

## Main Page
This page should contain some basic information that could be viewed by employers or friends

## Blog tab
I want the blog tab to work with RSS. This can be locally hosted. I dont know anything about blogging but the high level goal is to do some project writeups and publish some of my thoughts. A stretch goal would be to have a button where my friends could have my blog posts go to their email
## Links
I want to have a tab that links to articles or things that I think are interesting
## Contact
I ideally dont want to be spammed by bots but I want a way to have interested parties contact me, ex. Recruiters, colleagues, people who like what I write

## Inspiration
https://beta.vero.site/ - This is a simple site that allowed me to learn alot about the person and showed me some links of things they were interested in 



## Architecture
I want to keep the site simple. I have a cloudflare url I eventually would hook up to but for now github pages is sufficient. Ideally the most complexity the page would have is basic react. I dont currently see a need for a backend
